Stop using Java when creating your Android app! Create an application entirely in C++

I'm redoing the example for Windows (20/100%)  

tasks to be solved:
- a more convenient way to compile a project
- ~~connect to the project CURL (or similar that works with SSL)~~ ~~(use Java method HTTPConnection)~~ [USE C++ and OpenSSL!]
- ~~slightly change the structure of the project~~
- ~~Pull up the Java API (keyboard and so on)~~ (the main point is clear, the work will go properly)
- Abandon libc++_shared.so (so that everything is in one place .SO, there are no ways and ideas yet)  
  
## How to collect this information will be later
