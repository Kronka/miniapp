# miniapp
Stop using Java when creating your Android app! Create an application entirely in C++

It is not ready, in the process (95/100%)  
The rawdraw repository is used (I'll tell you everything later)[no longer used]  
"so many questions and so few answers"

tasks to be solved:
- a more convenient way to compile a project
- connect to the project CURL (or similar that works with SSL)
- ~~slightly change the structure of the project~~
- Pull up the Java API (keyboard and so on)
- Abandon libc++_shared.so (so that everything is in one place .SO, there are no ways and ideas yet)  
  
## How to collect this information will be later
