# MiniApp
The project is currently being reorganized.  
There are several reasons for this:  
For example, Apache Ant was removed in VS 2022,  
which now does not allow you to create an Android Native Activity template for building an Android application without Java dependencies. I am working on solving problems and gradually implementing everything.
